 * polyline from appending terminus_1.getPolylineIdx() onto
 * terminus_0.getPolylineIdx() using the Terminus points as the
 * join point.  Consider polylines A -> B and C -> D.  If
 * terminus_0 is B and terminus_1 is C, then this stitch
 * represents A -> B -> C -> D.  If terminus_0 is C and terminus_1
 * is A, then this stitch represents D -> C -> A -> B.  In
 * general, this stitch represents the polyline:
 *   the other terminus of polyline 0 -> terminus_0 -> terminus_1
 *     -> the other terminus of polyline 1.
 *
 * This class also stores the squared distance involved in making
 * the stitch.
